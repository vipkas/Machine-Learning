Decision tree is a graph which is used to model a decision. It represents a decision making concept visually and explicitly. Decision tree is also known as CART (Classification and Regression Trees) which is introduced by Leo Breiman to point an algorithm that used for classification and regression. CART algorithm provides some important techniques such **bagged decision trees, random forest and boosted decision trees**.\n","\n","![features example](assets/pic1.png)\n","\n","Decision tree model is binary tree which consists of several components, such:\n","\n","* Each **Node** represents data features (attributes/ x variables) [see Figure 7.1].\n","* Each **Branch** or **Link** or **Edge** represents the decision or rule.\n","* Each **leaf** represents decision result or variable output that is used as prediction.\n","\n","Some terms are also applied for decision tree, such:\n","\n","* **Splitting**: This kind of process to split a node becomes two or more sub-node.\n","* **Decision Node**: A form of node when processed to be following sub-node.\n","* **Pruning**: Deleting a sub-node. \n","* **Branch / Sub-Tree**: A part of tree.\n","* **Parent and Child Node (Node Induk dan Anak)**: Node, which is divided into several sub-node. The node which is on the upper level will be the parent and the following ones will be the child one."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ksnPbmdG_pO5"},"source":["## Tahapan Algoritma Decision Tree\n","\n","In Decision tree, creating tree is the first step that must be conducted.
